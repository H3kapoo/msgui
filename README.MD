# Msgui

Pronounced "miss gui" is a lightweight C++ GUI library build using OpenGL.

Pretty simple to use. No deep OOP hierarchies. No abstraction madness. Straight to the point.

Currently available UI elements include:
    - **Box** containers
    - Simple **Button**s
    - 
### Usage

Just drag&drop the zip containing the traces and press ```Extract```. Output will be created in ```output/``` folder
in the same directory as the dragged zip.
